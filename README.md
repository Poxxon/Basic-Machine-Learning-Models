# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects that Iâ€™ve been working on while learning and practicing different concepts of data analysis and predictive modeling. Each project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks and covers a range of machine learning techniques.

## Projects Overview

### 1. House Price Prediction
This project predicts house prices based on various features using regression models. The dataset used includes attributes such as the number of rooms, house size, and location.
- **Dataset**: [HousePricePrediction.xlsx](./path/to/HousePricePrediction.xlsx)
- **Notebook**: [HousePrediction.ipynb](./path/to/HousePrediction.ipynb)
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Linear Regression
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Evaluation

### 2. Solubility Model
A machine learning model to predict the solubility of chemical compounds. This project involves working with molecular data to build predictive models.
- **Notebook**: [SolubilityModel.ipynb](./path/to/SolubilityModel.ipynb)
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Cross-Validation
  - Model Tuning

### 3. Selling Price Prediction for Used Cars
This project focuses on predicting the selling prices of used cars based on features like brand, model, year, and mileage.
- **Dataset**: [sellingPriceUsedCars.xlsx](./path/to/sellingPriceUsedCars.xlsx) / [sellingPriceUsedCars.csv](./path/to/sellingPriceUsedCars.csv)
- **Notebook**: Coming Soon
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Hyperparameter Tuning

## Installation & Requirements

To run these projects, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Plans

- Add new machine learning models and techniques.
- Implement deep learning models for some projects.
- Further optimize existing models with advanced tuning techniques.
